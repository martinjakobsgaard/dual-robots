Some assembly sequences involve manipulation and handover of a workpiece from onerobot to another. This task is typically accomplished by having one robot static while theother approaches and performs handover. This project will investigate the possibility ofusing dual robot trajectory planning in order to transfer the piece from one robot to theother while both are in motion, in order to reduce cycle time.

The project will contain the following subjects
- Dual robot trajectory planning
- Real-time robot control
- Pose estimation (optional)
