# Dual-robots 
This project will investigate the possibility of using dual robot trajectory planning in order to successfully transfer a heavy arbitrary object from a start configuration to a goal configuration.
The path-planning utilize the RRT-connect method with a optimization method, shortcut, to shorten the path.
